** DONE Fake Baidu Server

- State "DONE"       from              [2016-06-13 Mon 19:09]
- [X] Mitigate by looking up Baidu IP with real DNS queries.
- [X] A more complete solution is to check the baidu certificate with https.

Need the aforementioned certificate check to mitigate this issue.

Though harder to fake, it's still relatively easy:

1. Change ARP records to map DNS IPs with local mac address.
2. Set up the fake DNS entries for baidu, which leads to a fake http server.

** DONE Tempered TZ

Set TZ like the following:
: TZ='Asia/Shanghai'; export TZ
This trick can extend the allowed access window from several hours to about 2 days.

Since June-13, locale time zone offset is checked and it's enforced to be 'GMT+8'
